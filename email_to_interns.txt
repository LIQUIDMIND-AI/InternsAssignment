Subject: Internship Assignment - Trade Shipment Anomaly Detective | Deadline: Feb 13th EOD

Hi Team,

We're excited to share your internship assignment! This is designed to test your ability to think critically, architect intelligent systems, and use AI tools effectively. You have **3 days** to complete this project.

**Assignment: Trade Shipment Anomaly Detective**

📋 Complete Assignment Details: https://github.com/LIQUIDMIND-AI/InternsAssignment

**What You'll Build:**
- An AI-powered anomaly detection system for trade shipments
- 3-layer detection architecture (Rule-based → Statistical → LLM-powered)
- A deployed web application with live analysis capabilities

**Timeline:**
- **Submission Deadline:** February 13th, 2026 (End of Day)
- **Evaluation Call:** February 14th, 2026 - 30-minute call with the LIQUIDMIND team

**What to Submit:**
✓ GitHub repository link with your complete code
✓ Live deployed application URL (Streamlit/HuggingFace Spaces/etc.)
✓ All deliverables as mentioned in the assignment (data, outputs, DESIGN_DECISIONS.md)

**Important Notes:**
1. **Use AI tools freely** (ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, etc.) - but understand what you build
2. Read the `DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` section carefully - this is critical
3. We will ask you to walk through your code and explain your decisions in the evaluation call
4. Focus on the "why" behind your choices, not just the "what"

**Evaluation Call (Feb 14th - 30 minutes):**
During the call, we'll ask questions like:
- Why did you choose X statistical method over Y?
- How does your LLM prompt work and why did you structure it that way?
- Walk us through this specific anomaly detection
- What would you change if this ran on production scale?

**Free Resources Mentioned in Assignment:**
- LLM APIs: OpenRouter, Groq, Together AI, GitHub Models, Google AI Studio
- Frontend tools: Lovable, Bolt, v0 (for rapid UI development)

If you have questions or face blocking issues, feel free to reach out. We're here to help with genuine blockers, not to solve the assignment for you.

This is your chance to showcase your problem-solving skills, technical depth, and ability to leverage AI effectively. We're excited to see what you build!

Best of luck!
